# AVL Tree Implementation with STL-like Interface

Welcome to the AVL Tree project! This project provides a fully functional AVL tree implementation in C++ with an STL–style interface. It includes full support for insertion, deletion, search, and iterator-based in-order traversal (both mutable and const iterators).

## Features

- **Balanced Binary Search Tree:**  
  An AVL tree that maintains balance after every insertion and deletion.
  
- **STL-Compatible Interface:**  
  Implements methods like `insert()`, `erase()`, `find()`, `clear()`, `size()`, `empty()`, and provides iterator support (`begin()`, `end()`, etc.) to allow in-order traversal.

- **Iterator Support:**  
  Both mutable and const iterators are available, enabling range-based for loops and standard iterator operations.

- **Templated Implementation:**  
  The AVL tree supports generic data types with customizable comparison functors.

## Project Structure

```
├── README.md
├── main.cpp                 # Sample main file demonstrating usage
├── AVLTreeHeader.hpp        # Header file containing the AVLTree class template definition and declarations.
└── AVLTreeImplementation.tpp# Templated implementation file with detailed comments.
```

- **AVLTreeHeader.hpp:**  
  Contains the declarations of the AVLTree class template, nested Node structure, public member functions, and the iterator types.

- **AVLTreeImplementation.tpp:**  
  Implements all the functions declared in the header file, including rotations, recursive insertion/deletion, and iterator methods with rich comments.

- **main.cpp:**  
  Provides an example on how to use the AVL tree (insert, delete, search, traverse, etc.).

## Installation and Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler with C++11 support or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

### Build Instructions (Using Command Line)

**Compile the Code:**

   For example, with `g++`:

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 -o avl_tree_app main.cpp
   ```
**Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   ./avl_tree_app
   ```

## Usage Example

Below is a quick sample of how to use the AVL tree in your project:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "AVLTreeHeader.hpp"

int main() {
    // Create an AVL tree container for integers.
    AVLTree<int> tree;

    // Insert elements into the AVL tree.
    tree.insert(15);
    tree.insert(10);
    tree.insert(20);
    tree.insert(8);
    tree.insert(12);
    tree.insert(16);
    tree.insert(25);
    tree.insert(5);

    // Traverse the AVL tree in-order using a range-based for loop.
    std::cout << "AVL Tree (in-order traversal): ";
    for (const auto &value : tree) {
        std::cout << value << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Find a value.
    auto it = tree.find(10);
    if (it != tree.end()) {
        std::cout << "Found 10 in the AVL tree." << std::endl;
    }

    // Delete a value.
    tree.erase(10);
    std::cout << "After deleting 10, AVL Tree: ";
    for (const auto &value : tree) {
        std::cout << value << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Check size and whether the tree is empty.
    std::cout << "Size of the AVL tree: " << tree.size() << std::endl;
    tree.clear();
    std::cout << "Tree cleared. Is tree empty? " << (tree.empty() ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Code Overview

The project is organized into two main files:

- **AVLTreeHeader.hpp**  
  Contains the class definitions along with the iterator class declarations. This file sets up the interface similar to STL containers.

- **AVLTreeImplementation.tpp**  
  Contains the detailed implementation of all methods:
  - Rotation functions (`leftRotate` and `rightRotate`)
  - Insertion and deletion (using recursion)
  - Helper functions (like height, balance factor, and finding the minimum node)
  - Iterator operations (increment, decrement, etc.)
  
Each function is commented with a detailed header explaining its purpose, parameters, and behavior.

Enjoy using the AVL Tree Implementation with an STL-like interface!
